# EVD-Room-Scanner
Android Studio project with native C++ vision processing. This is a school project for the Embedded Vision Minor at the Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen.

The Android Studio project was taken from https://github.com/d3alek/sensible-opencv. Credits for the project setup go to d3alek. 

The project is work in progress so I recommend not to use it (yet).

## How to compile
Clone this project and open it in Android Studio. Compile, run and enjoy the working Android, OpenCV Java and OpenCV C++ integration.
